All contributors to Recki-CT must sign a CLA.
=============================================

## What is a CLA?

A CLA (Contributor License Agreement) basically says that you own the
rights to any code you contribute, and that you give us permission to
use that code in Recki-CT. You maintain the copyright on that
code.

## Where do I sign up?

If you own all the rights to your code, you can fill out an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).


If your employer has any rights to your code, then they also need to fill
out a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html). 
If you don't know if your employer has any rights to your code, you should 
ask before signing anything.



## CLA Signers

By default, anyone with an @google.com email address already has a CLA
signed for them. Congratulations!

We've also received CLAs from the following people:

 * krakjoe (Joe Watkins)
 * dave1010 (David Hulbert)
 * andy.huang (Andy Huang)
 * GrahamCampbell (Graham Campbell)
 * pborreli (Pascal Borreli)
